# Python Implementation for Data structures and algorithms

## Day-01

Today we are going to see the implementation and understanding of following concepts and techniques.
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
3. Insertion Sort
4. Bubble Sort
5. Selection Sort
6. Generating subarrays
7. max sum of all possible subarrays
8. smallest and greatest element of the given array
   
    1. ### Linear Search
            
            Linear search is searching technique with very easy to implmentation.
